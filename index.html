                            <h4>Hedy Lamarr</h4>
                            <p>Hedy Lamarr was once considered “the most beautiful woman in the world”. Throughout her film career, the Hollywood actress starred in more than 30 films, including the classics "Samson and Delilah" and "History of Humanity". However, the diva was not content only with her prominence in the movies. Owner of an absurd intelligence, Hedy also had a great fascination for science. So much so that it is considered the inventor of frequency hopping, a technique that avoids message interception.</p>

                            <h4>Grace Hopper</h4>
                            <p>Also known as "The Queen of Computing", "Queen of Coding", "Admiral Grace", "Grandma COBOL" and "Grand Lady of Software". It may seem like an exaggeration, but to the woman who programmed the first large-scale digital computer and created the first compiler, the titles seem quite appropriate.</p>

                            <h4>Jeff Bezos</h4>
                            <p>The person of the year in 1999, elected by the Times, Bezos is even more influential today. He is reshaping the retail sector with giant Amazon. Bezos made big bets, founding the private spaceflight company Blue Origin and buying the Washington Post in 2013 for $250 million.</p>

                            <p>Nikola Tesla (1856-1943) was an inventor, Austro-Hungarian, born in Smiljan (Austro-Hungarian Empire), in current Croatia, who left important contributions to the development of the most important technologies of the last centuries, such as radio transmission, from robotics, remote control, radar, theoretical and nuclear physics, and computer science.</p>

                            <p>At 32, Zuckerbeg made history with the social network he created. Given the incredible power of Facebook content, how Zuckerberg handles these issues will have huge real-world impact across the planet.</p>
                            <p>When Mark Zuckerberg began writing the first Facebook codes at the age of 19 in his Harvard dorm, he began redefining the concept of Internet interaction.</p>

                            <p>As CEO of Apple, one of the world's most valuable brands, Cook has enormous influence over the tech world. Everything Apple does is followed by a large number of competitors, which means its choices echo. Rumors indicate that Apple is testing all kinds of technology, from artificial intelligence and augmented reality to autonomous vehicles, which shows the company's tendency to innovate more and more.</p>

                    <p>The first technologies emerged in the middle of the Industrial Revolution, however, at the beginning they were just practical innovations, knowledge placed in favor of services performed by extremely skilled mechanics, blacksmiths and carpenters, but who did not obtain the least amount of scientific knowledge.</p>

                            </figure>
                    <p>The union of technology and science will take place with the creation of the polytechnic school by Napoleon Bonaparte, who wanted to have high-level engineers on his team for his military ambitions.  Over the years, there have invariably been several evolutions of existing technologies, as well as others arising from such changes.</p>

                    <p>Referring us to the world of information technology and telecommunications, its evolution processes took place from the Second World War, with the discoveries in electronics, such as the first computer and the transistor, source of microelectronics, which became the true core of Technological Evolution of Information in the 20th century.  However, it was only in the mid-1970s that these technologies began to spread widely.</p>
                    <p>Since the diffusion of the first personal computers (PCs) by Apple and IBM, in 1981, there has been a very big leap in terms of technology and utility of these machines, characterized, already in the 1990s, by the extraordinary versatility of transforming the processing and storage of data centralized on a shared, interactive networked computer system.  Since then, this process, in turn, has only developed and spread in practically all areas of activity.</p>
